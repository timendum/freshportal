# FreshRSS Portal - React edition

FreshRSS Portal is a Javascript portal, composed by feed widgets, similar to the old iGoogle or Netvibes.

Any help is appreciated, on everything, I'm not a front-end developer.

## Installation

Just unzip the latest release (or build it by yourself) and put it somewhere, the only back-end needed is [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.github.io) itself.

1. Create a "`freshportal`" direcotry on the same web-server of FreshRSS
1. Put the build files in the directory
1. On the FreshRSS instance enable the API access.
1. The go to index.html.

## Details

This is a re-implementation of [the original ttportal](https://github.com/timendum/ttportal), but this time in React and for FreshRSS.

### Dependencies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling utility classes
